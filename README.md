# RaceDash
RaceDash is the same basic program as GridDash.
However, it is writted using JavaFX and has a more
involved and prettier GUI.  Runs best on a laptop. 
Can be made to run on a Raspberry Pi with alot of messing 
about after Oracle dropped JavaFX support for the ARM.
Looks better on a larger screen as well.
